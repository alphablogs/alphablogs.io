<p>Cryptocurrency is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange. It uses cryptographic functions to conduct financial transactions. Through cryptography, it also controls and creates new units while verifies the transfer of assets.</p>

<p>The top cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, partly because it is the one that started it all.</p>

<p>What makes cryptocurrency unique is that it is decentralized by nature and not controlled by any central or national bank. Cryptocurrency uses blockchain, which also makes it immune to control or interference by any government.</p>

<h2>So in brief:</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrency is a digital alternative to money that holds its value based on supply and demand.</p>

<p>It is of a truth that cryptocurrency is no more news to most people...as at last report on a statistics carried out by an american based research group atleast 42 million bit coin wallet exists.</p>
<p>42 Million Bitcoin Wallets.</p>
<p>Currently,42 million bitcoin wallets according to data compiled by Statista. However, most bitcoin users have several bitcoin wallets and use multiple wallet addresses to increase their financial privacy when transacting in bitcoin. Hence, the total number of bitcoin users must be less than 42 million.....although some have come to embrace the cryptocurrencies and it advantages due to FOMO(fear of missing out) some tend to embrace it due to fact and understanding they have on it.No matter how you've chosen to embrace or accept cryptocurrency ,the fact is it has come to stay.</p>
<h1>A BIT ABOUT MY CRYPTO JOURNEY</h1>

<p>I thought to myself how would I pay the bills and still meetup with socializing and the rest of my need if I cant earn an income everyday...this led me to a friend of mine who was working independently as a legal practitioner...we discussed at length and he mentioned some ways in which I could eventually become self employed soonest.</p>
<p>During the 2nd quarter of 2019 i had learned about cryptocurrency from a news article I read somewhere I visited,at first I thought to myself I will I be able to take my own share of this when I don't even have enough knowledge of it.</p>
